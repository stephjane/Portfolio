			<p class="textcenter padding">Born in South Florida where I was spoiled with sunshine and salt water throughout my childhood, I've always enjoyed anything and everything that gets me outside. During that time, I had a habit of finding little projects for myself and family furniture that needed my artistic touch (others disagreed). I like to think that was the creative side deciding to take over.</p>

			<p class="textcenter padding">My four years of college were spent at Auburn University. Vastly different and much smaller than my hometown, Auburn still managed to provide perspective and experiences I could've never expected. It was my junior year when I was introduced to HTML, and it was the first time work felt like fun.</p>

			<p class="textcenter padding">I made the move to Atlanta upon receiving an internship at a hospitality PR agency and then a healthcare agency. At some point, I realized I wanted to be on the other side of the table. Days were spent learning about revolutionary ideas people were bringing to life, and I was eager to join the side of creation. Remembering how much I enjoyed coding and design, I began to explore my options and couldn't be happier with my decision.</p>
